## Site Goals

* __User Goals__

  * There should be opportunity for the customer to read about what the gym does and its type of training.
  * Also plenty of information for the user to find out about the different membership types.

### First time visitors

* They will also be able to find a way of contacting the organisation through the contact form. 
* Also they will find links to social media at the bottom of each page.

### Design Choices
* Colour scheme
    * The main two colours being used are orange and blue, with an off white background #e7e7e7. Orange and blue were used as a vibrant colour to add brightness to the webpage and make it more eye catching.
* Typography
    * The font-family used for this website is Montserrat and sans-serif was set as the fall back font. Montserrat was used as it has a clean and stylish look.
* Imagery
    * The background image was used to add a proffessional look to the website. All images in the gallery were used to show a happy and hard working environment. 

### Wireframes

* All wireframes were created using Balsamiq wireframes, all designs for desktop, tablet and mobile are linked [here](documentation/wireframes/wireframes.pdf).

## Testing
* Navbar
    * Clicking on each navbar link takes the user to a different webpage. All nav links are working from each different webpage. The main logo works as a link to the homepage on each page as well. No errors found.
        * On a medium screen size the navbar links move underneath the main logo filling the width of the screen.
        * On a small screen the navbar links collapse into a dropdown menu which is opened when the user clicks on the icon.

* Hero image
    * Hero image is visible on all different website sizes, the one link in the hero image takes the user to the gallery. 
        * On smaller screens the hero text moves to the centre and is still fully visible. 

* About section
    * This section is fully visible on all screen sizes and is readable. The paragraph changes to the screen size and the schedule items move down to a different row if they do not fit the screen. 
        * On small screens the schedule items are all stacked on top of eachother. This makes it easier to read.

* Reviews 
    * On large screens the review items display alongside eachother.
        * On screens under 1200px will mean the items will stack on top of eachother for easier visibility.

* Footer 
    * The footer displays logos to four different social media sights, facebook, instagram, twitter and threads, when clicking on a logo the user is linked to the corrosponding webpage in a new tab. All links were tested in each webpage.

* Memberships 
    * There are four different memberships shown on the screen. All visible and readable at different screen sizes. 
        * On small screens the memberships stack on top of eachother fitting the screen.
  
* Gallery 
    * The gallery page shows different images all at the same size. On a large screen the images spread across four columns. 
        * On any screen under 1200px then the images span over two columns.

* Contact page 
    * The contact page contains a form, which requires a first name, last name and an email, the form can not be submitted unless these are inputed into the text input areas. There is also a text area for any quiestios the user may want to ask. The form changes size with the screen size and is fully visible in smaller screen sizes.



### Validator Testing

* <https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator> used to check CSS, tests returned no errors.
* <https://validator.w3.org/nu/> used to check HTML on each webpage.
    * index.html returned no warnings
    * about.html returned no errors
    * memberships.html returned no errors
    * gallery.html returned no errors
    * contact.html returned no errors.

###  Bugs found

* One bug found along the way was that the hero-image was not loading into the github pages but was laading into the codeanywhere preview. This was because a relative path was used and not the correct path type, so assets/images/hero-image.jpg was changed to ../images/hero-image.jpg.

    * In Github find the repository.
