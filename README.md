* Typography
    * The font-family used for this website is Montserrat and sans-serif was set as the fall back font. Montserrat was used as it has a clean and stylish look.
* Imagery
    * The background image was used to add a proffessional look to the website. All images in the gallery were used to show a happy and hard working environment. 

### Wireframes

* All wireframes were created using Balsamiq wireframes, all designs for desktop, tablet and mobile are linked [here](documentation/wireframes/wireframes.pdf)

## Testing
* Navbar
    * Clicking on each navbar link takes the user to a different webpage. All nav links are working from each different webpage. The main logo works as a link to the homepage on each page as well. No errors found.
        * On a medium screen size the navbar links move underneath the main logo filling the width of the screen.
        * On a small screen the navbar links collapse into a dropdown menu which is opened when the user clicks on the icon.

* Hero image
    * Hero image is visible on all different website sizes, the one link in the hero image takes the user to the gallery. 
        * On smaller screens the hero text moves to the centre and is still fully visible. 

* About section
    * This section is fully visible on all screen sizes and is readable. The paragraph changes to the screen size and the schedule items move down to a different row if they do not fit the screen. 
        * On small screens the schedule items are all stacked on top of eachother. This makes it easier to read.

* Reviews 
    * On large screens the review items display alongside eachother.
        * On screens under 1200px will mean the items will stack on top of eachother for easier visibility.

* Footer 
    * The footer displays logos to four different social media sights, facebook, instagram, twitter and threads, when clicking on a logo the user is linked to the corrosponding webpage in a new tab. All links were tested in each webpage.
